# Devide And Conquer Technique

Devide & Conquer is a general Algorithm design technique. By employing this technique, the problem's instance is divided into several smaller instances typically of equal size, and Solving each such problem.

## The Best known Problems that are solved using Divide & Conquer method are

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Tree Traversals
- Defective Chess Board etc.

# General Plan/ General Method

Divide & Conquer Algorithms work according to the following General plan/General Method:

> 1. Divide a Problem's (input) instance into several smaller instances of the same problem. Typically of about the same size. i.e., a good number of instances of the same problem of smaller size.

> 2. Solve recursively smaller instances of the problem.

> 3. Now combine solutions obtained for the smaller instances to get a solution to the original instance.
