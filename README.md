# DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS

`Resources and Solutions` `^_^`

<!-- I am _Pawan Gupta_ a student of GLA University,Mathura,
an aspiring **Web Developer** and **Competitive Programmer**. -->

I have compiled many useful links for **Data Structures and Algorithms** questions and their solutions.  
I have also listed the **Theory Subjects**, which are often ignored by students but must have vast knowledge of it to help them in their interviews.  
I have also included the **Placement Ready Roadmap**, from `beginner level -> interview ready candidate`

## üèÜ Roadmap to Dream Placement

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ 100+ Top Product Based Companies

People only chase after **FAANG**, because that's what is hyped up but now there are a lot of companies which:  
`Pay Exceptionally Well`  
`Good Work Life`  
`Great Projects/Learning`  
Check their names [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15rjcHqjDN7gPU5e6nxb_9NdApRf4TW1I/view?usp=sharing), and decide where you want to land.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Language, Data Structures, CP

- Guide to how to start coding if you have zero knowledge about this field
- Only way to become good at something is practice, an expert was once a nubie too
- Only consistency matter, coding once a week for 10 hours is not benificial, rather coding 1 hour each day will benifit you more.

## üèÜ DSA Practice Resources

<p>
Remember: Deliberate practice does not mean looking for answers and memorizing it. You won't go very far with that approach. The more you are able to solve a problem yourself without any reference to answers, the more you will improve.
</p>

### [üî∞DSA Crack Sheet](./DSA%20Crack%20Sheet)

Data Structures and Algorithms Cracks Sheet (created by @lovebabbar) contains most necessary questions to learn and grasp about most common and important DS and Algos

### [üî∞Striver SDE Sheet](./Striver%20Sheet)

Software Developer Engineer Sheet (created by @striver) contains asked during interwies by good product based companies.

The sheet is divided in 30 parts to be completed in a month to get ready for interview at a good company

### [üî∞Top Interview Preparation Questions](./Leetcode%20Top%20Interview%20Questions)

This is LeetCode's official curated list of Top classic interview questions to help you land your dream job. Our top interview questions are divided into the following series:

    - Less I/O would be needed to load or swap user programs into memory, so each user program would run faster
    - Degree of Multiprogramming increases
    - allows file and memory to be shared by 2 or more processes through page sharing
  - If it is used carelessely, it can decrease performance

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Database Management & Design

Tech Gaints: They usually ask only a bit about normalization, ACID properties(imp.) ans SQP queries & interview is done

Start Ups: They do focus on system design a lot ans in between questions on DBMS are frequently asked
So, we need to be 100% prepared for it & best way is to follow the System Design Primer (resource given below)
Questions always revolves around the type of DB, why this DB, why not that DB, how to scale, SQL vs NoSQL, your familiarity level with those DBs, etc
