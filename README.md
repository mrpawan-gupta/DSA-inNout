# `üèÜ The Complete DSA Preparation üèÜ`

This repository contains all the DSA (Data-Structures, Algorithms, 450 DSA by Love Babbar Bhaiya,STriver Series ,FAANG Questions and Many More!).

***Before dive into this repo you should know why do we need these concepts. What is Role of [DSA in your real life](https://mrpawan-gupta.medium.com/role-of-data-structures-algorithms-for-software-engineer-a6b1ea5a8701)??***


‚ÄúFor solving any real-world problem with programming approach we need to follow some steps & strategy. The collection of that steps is Algorithm, whereas a data structure is a way to store and organize data during solving that problem or constructing any software so that it can be used efficiently in terms of time and space, this way Data structure & Algorithms always allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.‚Äù


* ***STL*** is standard template library, It is most powerful & useful while solving competitive coding questions [Read More](https://github.com/mrpawan-gupta/DSA-inNout/tree/main/Resources/Cpp/CPP-STL).
